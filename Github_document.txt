The Terminal - use either VS Code or PyCharm
In today's lessons we'll be using the Terminal and the command line to learn about git and version control. Just a quick note, in the videos you'll see me using the Terminal in VS Code instead of PyCharm.

Use the PyCharm Terminal
However, a Terminal is a Terminal, and so you can follow along using PyCharm without any issues. You can find PyCharm's terminal here:


Or download VS Code
If you prefer to match what you see me using in the videos, you can also download and install VS Code from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/



Bash commands on Windows
Windows does not have Bash nor git pre-installed. To follow along as a Windows user, you'll need to install Git Bash as per the next lesson.
